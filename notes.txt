this is designed for windows but may have support for other OS...

WINDOWS:
 %APPDATA%
  .minecraft -- if this doesnt exist we should ask for other location
   assets
    indexes -- lots of JSON, separated by game version
               every object is a file's PATH assigned to a HASH with a SIZE
               these files only exist if you have installed some version
    objects -- where the hashed files are located
     XX -- the first two characters of a hash, call it a group.

on the subject of indexes:
 each major version has it's own json file, with some exceptions:
  release 1.13.1 thru 1.13.2 is "1.13.1.json"
  release 1.13 gets it's own "1.13.json"
  release 1.7.10 gets it's own "1.7.10.json"
  release 1.7.4 thru 1.7.9 is "1.7.4.json"
  release 1.7.3 gets it's own "1.7.3.json"
  release 1.6 thru 1.7.2 is "legacy.json"
  anything older than 1.6 is "pre-1.6.json" (tested down to 1.2.5)

from the wiki, the format in pack.mcmeta should be set accordingly:
 1.6.1  - 1.8.9   = 1
 1.9    - 1.10.2  = 2
 1.11   - 1.12.2  = 3
 1.13   - 1.14.4  = 4
 1.15   - 1.16.1  = 5
 1.16.2 - 1.16.5  = 6
 1.17   - 1.17.1  = 7
 1.18             = 8

before 1.6.1 we have texture-pack instead, meaning a different folder structure
 whatever, the paths are listed anyways.

before 1.5 we have a texture atlas.
