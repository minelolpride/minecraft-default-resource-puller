# minecraft-default-resource-puller

This script is intended to pull the default assets of a Minecraft installation and arrange them into a functioning resource-pack.

Here, it is assumed that you own the game and have run it at some point. Hashed asset extraction works for most versions, but jar asset extraction only works in version 1.6.1 or later. (soon to change?)

If your game is installed in a location that *isnt* `.minecraft`, you can redirect the script to look elsewhere for assets and jars.
